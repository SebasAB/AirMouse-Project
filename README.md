# AirMouse-Project
This is part of the **ubiquitous computing** class from the software engineer carrer in UDLA.

# Main Goal 
The main goal of this project was to develop an app using App Inventor that could manage data from different sensors that are included in your smarthphone. 
In this case we're using the accelerometer sensor. 
This will work using software like Realterm that can connect to the app via bluetooth and will create a file, in this case **data.txt** and the python script will read from it and will move the mouse of your computer while you're moving your smarthphone. 

To right click you have to tap one time the "Right click" button in the app and to release it you'll have to do the same thing.
